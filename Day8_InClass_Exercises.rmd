# Exercises: 

Make a list that contains the information on a single playing card. Suit, face, and value. 

```{r}
playing_card <- list(suit = "Spades", face = "Ace", value = 1)

```


Make a second list where each element contains all the options for suit, face, and value, respectively. 

```{r}
second_list <- list(
  suit = c("Spades", "Hearts", "Guns", "Nukes", "Degrees"),
  face = c("Rosevelt", "Washington", "Lincoln"),
  value = 1:3
)
```


If `Newlist <- list(a=1:10, b="Good morning", c="Hi")`, write an R statement that will add 1 to each element of the first vector in Newlist.

```{r}
Newlist <- list(a=1:10, b="Good morning", c="Hi")

Newlist <- Newlist$a + 1

```

If `b <- list(a=1:10, c="Hello", d="AA")`, write an R expression that will give all elements of the first vector of b, except the second, and write another that returns only elements of `a` that are greater than 7.

```{r}
b <- list(a=1:10, c="Hello", d="AA")

b$a[-2]
b$a[b$a > 7]

```

Let `x <- list(a=5:10, c="Hello", d="AA")`, write an R statement to add a new item z = "NewItem" to the list x.

```{r}
x <- list(a=5:10, c="Hello", d="AA")

x$z <- "NewItem"
x
```
